# Bad UX of OTP

Something as small as the order of words in a text message can make a big difference in the user experience. 

Take, for example, the one-time password (OTP) that is required for many banking transactions. 

I have been an SBI user for years and I have always dreaded the process of receiving and entering the OTP. 

The 6-digit code is always buried at the end of a long text message and hidden in the notification banner, making it a hassle to find and enter.

But all of that changed when I switched to Kotak (not a promotion). 

The OTP is the first thing in the text message and it's so simple, yet it makes such a huge difference in the user experience. 

It's amazing how we often ignore these small details in our daily lives and don't realize how bad they were until we find something better.

So, next time you're struggling to find your OTP in a sea of notifications, remember how a simple change in the order of words can make all the difference in the world.
