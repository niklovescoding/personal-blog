# Survivorship Bias

How to assure the successful return of your bombers?

That was the concern of the US military in WWII. They started to examine the planes that successfully returned. 

After a while, they figured out that there was a pattern where bullets hit those planes. 

Center, Wings, and Tail.

What could you have done in that case? I can say with surety that you and US military were thinking the same thing.

Armor those places.

But that's a fallacy and Abraham Wald, a mathematician proved this fallacy.

Because no one was looking at the pattern of return of those plans. All those plans that were hit on center, wings, and tail returned successfully. 

So, that meant those were the strongest part of the bomber’s body and planes that got hit at many other parts didn’t make their way back. 

In the end, the US military worked on armoring the parts that were not hit on those returned planes, as Wald suggested.

This is known as survivorship bias. 

This fallacy has stuck in the mind of many people. They look at successful companies. Successful businesses. 

But there was one article where I read that if you look at those successful companies and study their early stages where they just got started if you don’t see a pattern in their growth, then their success was total luck.

Also, it is said that if you try to mimic these successes around you there are very low chances of your success.

But sadly, there is not much written around the failure, the way they failed, how they failed.
