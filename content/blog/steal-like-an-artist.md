# Steal like an artist

This is the book that I finished yesterday. 

Just a tiny piece. 

Barely a 2 hours read.

I already knew a few of these things (almost). But those were staying back in my mind. 

This book proved like a good refresher. And let me refresh the lessons for you guys as well. 

When you copy from a single source, people will call it plagiarism but if you copy it from a lot of sources people call it an original piece

An artist is a collector of ideas. Write down everything you can. Take a notebook with you everywhere you can. Someone said something. Not of your use right now, but sounds interesting?. Write it down. Save these thefts for later. 

An artist collects selectively. Else there would be no difference between a hoarder and an artist. 

Have mentors. People that inspire you. See who were the people they got inspired from. Keep doing it and do it till you make a large tree. When you think it is enough. Make your own branch.

You might see dead people in this process. The great thing about dead masters is that they can’t refuse you as an apprentice. They left the lessons in their work.

A wonderful flaw about human beings is that we’re incapable of making perfect copies. Our failure to copy our heroes is where we discover where our own thing lives. That is how we evolve. Examine where you fall short. That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own
work. Adding something to the world that only you can add.

Creativity is subtraction. Don’t add more to whatever you do. Just figure out what you can cut. The right constraints can lead to your very best work.

Do you want to be “known”? People will say “Do good work”. Woah! We know that already, don’t we? Let’s cut this down. 

It is really simple on the Internet. Just wonder at something and invite others to wonder with you.

Try to be a boring person when needed. Because a boring person gets the most work done.
